According to the latest data, the most risky sector to invest in Nova Scotia from the following list is Travel & Accommodation. This is based on a report by Statistics Canada that shows that this sector experienced the largest decline in GDP and employment due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 20211. The report also indicates that this sector faces significant challenges in recovery due to travel restrictions, reduced consumer demand, and labour shortages1. Other sectors that are considered risky are Fish & Seafood Processing and Energy, which also suffered from lower exports, prices, and demand due to the global crisis1.

Another report that suggests this is the Business Plan 2021-22 by the Department of Inclusive Economic Growth. This report states that the tourism, hospitality, travel, events and performing arts sectors continue to feel the shock of the global pandemic and need more support for mitigation, adaptation and recovery2.
