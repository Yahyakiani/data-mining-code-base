Poor LMI can thwart good decision making, resulting in a misallocation between workers and jobs, thus undermining productivity, incomes and output growth. The complex challenges in today's labour market along with the continuing devolution of program responsibility to the provinces underscore the importance of reassessing and enhancing Canada's LMI.

Prince Edward Island received nearly 1,000 immigrants in 2007, its largest number since World War II.  Atlantic Canada's share of Canadian immigration reached 2.4% in 2007, the highest share since 1980, but this is still quite low compared to the region's 7.1% of Canada's population.  This dramatic growth in immigration reflects the impact of provincial nominee programs, which accounted for 82% of the increase in Atlantic immigration between 2002 and 2006.",https://www.apec-econ.ca/publications/view/?do-load=1&publication.id=125&site.page.id=51001,,Restricted,NA,Regional,2008,Immigrants

Other risks facing seniors' incomes include declining private sector pension coverage, a continuing shift to defined contribution schemes, and low contributions to RRSPs.  Seniors are compensating for the drop in planned pension income by delaying full retirement, with labour force participation rates of those aged 65-69 more than doubling in Atlantic Canada since 2001 from 6.8% to 15.6% in 2008.

86,BuildForce Canada,research,The state of women in construction in Canada,"In industrialized countries worldwide, it is predicted that industry in general, and the construction industry in particular, will face a serious shortfall of skilled workers in the next decade. Global competition for skilled workers will intensify as a result. The projected declines in skilled labour will be driven by demographic trends and national up-skilling strategies that promote university education over other educational pathways to prepare for global competition in the knowledge economy. In response, the Canadian construction industry is taking steps to expand the domestic labour pool by improving access to industry careers by older workers, Aboriginal peoples, immigrants and women. Despite successful initiatives to increase the numbers of women in the construction industry, the rate of their participation, particularly in the trades and onsite construction management, has not grown significantly over time. To address this problem, questions about the challenges and barriers women face must be reopened. This research examines the barriers, as well as good practices that could be implemented to overcome them. The Construction Sector Council conducted this research between 2008 and 2009 using literature review, secondary data analysis, a survey, interviews and focus groups. The purpose of the research was to guide industry in establishing benchmarks for change and to document the good practices needed to achieve it.",http://www.buildforce.ca/en/products/state-women-construction-canada,,Open,NA,Sectoral,2010,Any / All

272,"Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada",research,International Mobility of Highly Skilled Workers: A Synthesis of Key Findings and Policy Implications,"Highly skilled labour is an essential input to an innovative economy. In recent decades, highly skilled workers have become more mobile internationally. Furthermore, high demand for skills in industrialized countries has led to intense international competition for these mobile workers. Immigration and emigration, either temporary or permanent, of highly skilled workers can help provide Canada with people with needed skills; but if Canada's overall attractiveness to these workers is insufficient, they will go elsewhere. Canada needs to adjust to new skills requirements and global skills competition in order to support a more innovative knowledge-based economy. An essential element of this adjustment is to increase Canada's ability to attract and retain highly skilled workers. The chief issue challenging policymakers is how to structure policy responses to benefit from the international mobility of highly skilled workers, taking into consideration the variety of ways the mobility of the highly skilled affects the domestic labour market and the economy. The aim of this synthesis report is to support policy development by drawing on the research findings from the projects conducted under the Skills Research Initiative (SRI) supplemented by other research.",https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/eas-aes.nsf/vwapj/SRIsr04.pdf/$FILE/SRIsr04.pdf,,Open,NA,National,2008,Any / All

LEAP is a longitudinal file of companies (legal entities in the taxation system), not establishments. For each business, annual estimates of total payroll and employment are calculated. The latter is an average count of employees within the firm, and does not distinguish between full-time and part-time workers. This payroll and employment information is then organized longitudinally, that is, each observation on the database corresponds to a particular firm whose employment, payroll and industry characteristics are recorded at different points in time. The longitudinal nature of LEAP allows entry and exit times to be measured with precision. Entrants (or 'births') in any given year are firms that have current payroll data, but that did not have payroll data in the previous year.
